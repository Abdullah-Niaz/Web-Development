A CSS selector can contain more than one simple selector. Between the simple selectors, we can include a combinator.

        There are four different combinators in CSS:

                descendant selector (space)
                child selector (>)
                adjacent sibling selector (+)
                general sibling selector (~)



What are Pseudo-classes?
    A pseudo-class is used to define a special state of an element.

        For example, it can be used to:

                Style an element when a user mouses over it
                Style visited and unvisited links differently
                Style an element when it gets focus
